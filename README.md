📅 Week 1 Tasks

This week covers 3 Data Science & Analysis tasks.

✅ Task 1: Titanic Dataset EDA
1) Performed **Data cleaning**:
  - Filled missing values (Age → Median, Fare → Mean)
  - Removed duplicates
2) Created visualizations:
  - Survival count by gender (bar chart)
  - Age distribution (histogram)
  - Correlation heatmap
3) **Key Insights:**
  - Females had a higher survival rate than males
  - Younger passengers had better survival chances
  - Higher class passengers (Pclass 1) had better chances of survival.
  - Fare correlated positively with survival

✅ Task 2: Sentiment Analysis (IMDB Reviews)
1) Preprocessed reviews:
  - Lowercased text
  - Removed stopwords & special characters
2) Converted text into numerical format using **CountVectorizer (Bag of Words)**
3) Trained a **Logistic Regression model**
4) **Evaluation:**
  - Accuracy: `0.8735%`  
5) **Example Predictions:**
  - "This movie was fantastic!I loved the story and acting." → Positive
  - "Worst film ever.Completely boring and a waste of time." → Negative

✅ Task 3: Predicting House Prices (Boston Housing Dataset)
1) Normalized numerical features using **StandardScaler**
2) Trained a **Linear Regression model**
3) **Evaluation:**
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): `4.928602182665336`  
4) **Example Prediction:**
  - Predicted price for sample house: `28.996723619824877`
