‚úÖ Task 2: Sentiment Analysis (IMDB Reviews)
1) Preprocessed reviews:
  - Lowercased text
  - Removed stopwords & special characters
- Converted text into numerical format using **CountVectorizer (Bag of Words)**

2) **Evaluation:**
  - Accuracy: `XX%`  ‚Üê (replace with your score)
  - Optional: Precision/Recall available in notebook
3) **Example Predictions:**
  - "This movie was fantastic!" ‚Üí Positive
  - "Worst film ever." ‚Üí Negativ

‚úÖ Task 3: Predicting House Prices (Boston Housing Dataset)
1) Normalized numerical features using **StandardScaler**
2) Trained a **Linear Regression model**
3) **Evaluation:**
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): `XX`  ‚Üê (replace with your RMSE)
4) **Example Prediction:**
  - Predicted price for sample house: `XX`
  - Actual price: `XX`
